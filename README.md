## What is ContextFlow?

ContextFlow is a personal automation tool that keeps your AI coding sessions connected. If you're tired of re-explaining your project to ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI assistants every time you start a new conversation, ContextFlow solves that problem.

It automatically captures what you're working on, saves session notes, and gives you ready-to-paste context for your next AI session.

### Key Features

- **AI Context Preservation** - Automatically extract and format project context for new AI sessions
- **Session Documentation** - Auto-update project management tools (JIRA, GitHub, Confluence)
- **Workflow Automation** - Keep consistent notes and documentation
- **Session Tracking** - Complete history of all your work with searchable logs
- **Multi-Platform Integration** - Works with Confluence, JIRA, GitHub, Notion, and more
- **Project Templates** - Pre-configured setups for different project types
- **Secure Credential Management** - No plaintext passwords, uses system keyring
- **Personal & Team Friendly** - Works great solo or with small teams

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

#### "contextflow command not found"
If the `contextflow` command isn't found after installation:

1. **Check if Python bin directory is in PATH:**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH | grep -o '/Users/[^/]*/Library/Python/[^/]*/bin'
   ```

2. **Add Python bin to PATH (macOS):**
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Use full path instead:**
   ```bash
   /Users/yourusername/Library/Python/3.9/bin/contextflow --help
   ```

#### "No module named contextflow"
If you get import errors:

1. **Reinstall in development mode:**
   ```bash
   cd contextflow
   pip install --user -e .
   ```

2. **Check Python path:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import sys; print('\n'.join(sys.path))"
   ```

### Integration Issues

#### "JIRA/Confluence credentials not configured"
This was a known issue that has been fixed. If you still see this:

1. **Verify credentials are stored:**
   ```bash
   contextflow credentials
   ```

2. **Re-setup credentials if needed:**
   ```bash
   contextflow setup jira
   contextflow setup confluence
   ```

3. **Test the connection:**
   ```bash
   contextflow status
   ```

#### Keyring Access Issues
If you get keyring-related errors:

1. **macOS**: Ensure Keychain Access is working
2. **Linux**: Install `python3-keyring` package
3. **Windows**: Ensure Windows Credential Manager is accessible

### Common Issues

#### SSL/TLS Warnings
The urllib3 SSL warnings are harmless and don't affect functionality. They occur due to macOS system Python configuration.

#### Permission Errors
If you get permission errors during installation:
```bash
# Use --user flag to install in user directory
pip install --user -e .
```
